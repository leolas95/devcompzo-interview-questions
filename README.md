Interview questions
===

Repo to host all of the interview questions for the community's mock interviews.

We have mainly two types of interviews:

+ Technical, mainly coding challenges
+ Non-technical, to assess soft-skills and behavior

Adding questions

1. Clone the repo if you haven't
2. Create a new branch describing what you're adding, e.g: "add-very-hard-challenge"
3. Place it on its own directory, and inside the technical or non-technical directory
4. When finished, push your new branch
5. Create a pull request
5. Profit.
